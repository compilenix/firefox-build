# env_reset is disabled or HOME is present in the env_keep list.

# We enable always_query_group_plugin to restore old behavior.
# Disable this option for new behavior.

## Next comes the main part: which users can run what software on
## which machines (the sudoers file can be shared between multiple
## systems).
## Syntax:
##
## 	user	MACHINE=COMMANDS
##
## The COMMANDS section may have other options added to it.
##
## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root	ALL=(ALL) 	ALL

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel	ALL=(ALL)	ALL

## Same thing without a password
# %wheel	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL
firefox	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL
